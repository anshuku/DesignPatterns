/*
 * Singleton design pattern is used to create single instance of a class.
 * 
 * Bill Pugh Singleton support lazy loading in both single and multi-threaded environments
 *
 * Singleton Design Pattern - It's a creational design pattern and it returns the single instance of a class.
 * It's used in classes which are expensive and very time consuming to create - Connection factory, REST adapters, Dao, etc.
 * 
 * It needs three things viz. - 
 * private constructor to prevent instantiation with new operator.
 * public static method to return single instance of a class.
 * private static variable to store the single instance of a class
 * 
 * 
 * Bill Pugh Singleton design pattern support lazy loaded singleton object
 * (defers the initialization of the instance till itâ€™s referred).
 * Prevents eager loading and overheads of lock/unlock due to synchronization.
 * 
 * Class loader in java only loads the static inner class SingletonHelper in memory once
 * even if multiple threads call getInstance.
 * Also the static nested class SingletonHelper will be initialized and assign the field the first time
 * when we invoke getInstance.
 * Class initialization occurs the first time we use of it's methods or fields.
 * 
 * Static variables are class members that are shared among all objects.
 * There is only one copy of them in main memory.
 * Static fields and blocks are initialized one after the other.
 * 
 * It helps to achieve initialization on demand.
